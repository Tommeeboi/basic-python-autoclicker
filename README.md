# Simple Python Autoclicker
## By Tommeeboi
A very simple autoclicker made in Python. Due to Python being incredibly slow it only clicks around 9.2 cps

You can use this as a template if you want

## How To Use
For the default exe file, just run it. Your antivirus might see it as suspicious, just wait for it to scan the file

If you want to run the source code, install pyautogui:
```
pip install pyautogui
```

## Compile Source Code
First, you need to have Python installed, and have it added to PATH

You need to install pyinstaller if you haven't already:
```
pip install pyinstaller
```
And compile to executable:
```
pyinstaller --onefile clicker.py
```
After you compile, you can delete the build folder and .spec file
